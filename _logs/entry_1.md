I'm thinking of writing down about some things that have been on my mind for a long time. The things I want to write can usually be about my personal thoughts, the things I learned, or the books I read.

I believe, I have to write logs in more natural way rather than the usual technical blog style. So without further ado, let me set my mind free.

Nowadays experiencing myself socially weak. I have difficulty expressing my thoughts clearly.
