I'm thinking of writing down about some things that have been on my mind for a long time. The things I want to write can usually be about my personal thoughts, the things I learned, or the books I read.

I believe, I have to write logs in more natural way rather than the usual technical blog style. So without further ado, let me set my mind free.

Nowadays experiencing myself socially weak. I have difficulty expressing my thoughts clearly. I don't know why, but I'm having a hard time, it hurts. I perceive people around me as a potential threat and so I try to be very careful when talking to them. The reason I do this is because I think they will hurt me if they know my weakness. After all, it's making me suffer because I can't be myself. Living like this is really hard and painful for me.

I haven't been able to read a book for a long time because I have a lot of work. In the past, when I read a lot, the book was a balm for me. Reading books helped me express my thoughts more easily and helped me feel better.
